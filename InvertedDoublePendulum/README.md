# Inverted Double Pendulum Control

![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/20/?title=Progress&width=430&color=cc163a)

> Double inverted pendulum system consists of two rigid bars connected by frictionless hinges, where the lower bar is connected to a driven cart that can move horizontally on a plane. The objective is to maintain the two bars in an upright position by continuously adjusting the applied force to the left or right.

## Task Description
Reinforcement learning for stabilizing a double inverted pendulum.
- [x] Environment setup and implementation
- [ ] Q-function representation (e.g., MLP or LSTM)
- [ ] Training for cart-pole stabilization
- [ ] Analyzing reward curve
- [ ] Testing control effectiveness
