# Urban Air Quality Prediction

![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/100/?title=Progress&width=430&color=14ac66)

> In recent years, with the continuous development of China's economy and society, as well as the accelerated process of industrialization and urbanization, air pollution has become increasingly severe. Air pollutants mainly include carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (O3), as well as particulate matter such as inhalable particles (PM10) and fine particles (PM2.5). Air quality has a direct and significant impact on human production and living, and can even lead to a series of health and safety issues.

Air quality has a direct and significant impact on human production and living, and can even lead to a series of health and safety issues. Therefore, establishing a scientifically sound air quality prediction model and improving the monitoring and early warning capabilities of air quality are of great practical significance.

> This study takes the hourly air quality data from March 2013 to February 2017 at environmental monitoring stations in Beijing as an example for air quality prediction. The dataset consists of 31,876 samples, each containing the concentration values of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, O3, as well as monitoring values of temperature, pressure, dew point temperature, and wind speed for each hour at the monitoring stations.
