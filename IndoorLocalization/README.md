# Indoor Wi-Fi Localization

The indoor positioning dataset for wireless signals consists of 2000 samples, each sample having 7 attributes and 4 categories. This dataset utilizes the information from 7 Wi-Fi signals on a mobile phone to identify the location of four rooms indoors.

According to the instructions provided in the experimental document, I conducted tests using two different network architectures: One-Vs-One linear support vector machine (SVM) and multilayer perceptron (MLP).
